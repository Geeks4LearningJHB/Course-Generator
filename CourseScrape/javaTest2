We will also use the tool "Cookie Cutter" which can help you do something like: - Check if a page contains HTML tags (to check whether it uses XSS) - Check whether a specific element of your webpage is used in certain ways - Find out if one or more images are being downloaded (and if so, who was responsible?) - Download or save cookies without storing them (using a plugin called Cookie Collector) - Search a database of all cookies by name - Delete a particular user's personal information If you want to see a full screen version of this tutorial click here.

### Real-world Application

Explain a real-world application of'About Cookies' with practical examples 2.0.4 - Fixed bug #12077 (SSL certificate validation). Thanks to @lmwagner for reporting this issue! 

 Thanks to everyone who sent in feedback and suggestions, we are constantly improving our apps and you can help us by leaving reviews or rating the app in the App Store. If there's something you'd like to see in future versions, please let me know at support@codingbyhumans.com. I'm always looking forward to hearing from all you wonderful developers out there!

### Conceptual Model

Create a conceptual model or framework to understand'About Cookies' for beginner students. Create and implement a set of guidelines on how to store, manage, use and share personal data in an effective way. 

 This is especially relevant when it comes to social media platforms like Facebook (which has been criticised by the European Parliament over its privacy policies). Students should know what information they are collecting about themselves, which can be used against them in various ways including blackmailing.

### Common Misconceptions

Describe 2-3 common misconceptions about'About Cookies' and clarify them. When you click on a link, do not immediately follow the instructions that appear there. Try to find out what is required before doing anything else (or ask yourself if this might be something you'd want your friend or family member to know). This can help prevent misunderstandings as well as keep things more straightforward for both of you! 

 What to do when someone asks "How's my cookies?" This is an important question for many people and it comes up so often in conversations. There are two main reasons why this happens: 1) You've been asked to describe how they taste, but haven't yet explained their texture, consistency etc... It may also come from having no idea who exactly you're talking with at first… so don't just say, "They taste like cookie dough!" or "I think I'm tasting vanilla". Don't make assumptions about other peoples food tastes.
