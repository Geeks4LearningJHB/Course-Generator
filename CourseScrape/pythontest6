### Example: Suggest a title for module 1 of 5 in a beginner course on python. 4) How can I integrate the modules with a framework like Flask? What are the most common use cases? First of all, if you want to integrate some of the modules into a framework or application, the best way is to just define them as classes and add them to your project's requirements. Then you can just make sure that they are accessible from your framework/application by implementing the appropriate __init__.py and __getattr__.__getattr_from__ methods in those classes. In case you want a different module in your framework, you can simply import it in your app, and then you can change the functionality of that module using its __init___.py method., you should think about using a framework to provide the necessary functionality for your app. For example, the Flask Framework provides a lot of useful things such as authentication and database access. However, if your app uses a lot more functionality than what the framework provides, you might
