# Module 1: Module 1: Suggest Course Java Sure Was Book Cache That Memory Too

## Overview



## Learning Objectives



## Module Outline



### Example: Suggest a title for module 1 of 5 in a beginner course on java programming - and the course author is not sure if that's even legal. - and the class was never completed, and it's been more than two years since I asked for a copy. Suggest a text book or a reference book on how to implement an in-memory cache in your app - and there were none in existence.. I spent three weeks trying to find a suitable project that could use a memory cache - but it was really too complex for me (or too hard to maintain). Suggest a simple program written in Java that uses a memory buffer as input. No matter what you choose, make sure it doesn't involve using heap memory!
