### Example: Suggest a title for module 3 of 5 in a beginner course on python. No, this is not a joke. The Python community is very aware of this situation and many people are actively working on a solution. Many people are using the following tools to solve the problem: As I'm sure you all know by now, this situation has been solved (or at least substantially improved) by Python's standard library.
