What is the current state of C++11 support?Â¶ We're about two weeks away from C++14, and it's already clear that some features are already supported in C++17. There have been several discussions about what C++15 will contain, but there are also questions about whether or not C++21 will be ready by the end of 2017. In this issue of the CppCon 2017 newsletter we'll be looking at the status of the current proposal and whether C++20 should be considered. C++ is often criticized for lacking good standardization, and C++ will continue to face challenges in the future as the language matures. But with these changes, C++ has made significant progress toward becoming an open-source software development tool, and the community has the tools they need to make their work better. The C++ Standard Library has undergone a major overhaul since C++10. It includes new types and functions, a new set of template classes, improved
